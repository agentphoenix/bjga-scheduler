_When you create a recurring event, you need to flag any conflicts, but what do we do about those conflicts?_

In order to handle conflicts, we'd need a user credits system in place. If there's a conflict, we wouldn't book the appointment on that date and instead give the user credit for booking private lessons. If conflicts exist for more than 50% of the dates, the user won't be able to book.
